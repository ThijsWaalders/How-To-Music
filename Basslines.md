# Create nice sounding basslines
Here I'll explain how to create some nice sounding basslines that will fit in your track.
There are many ways and each one will be very different so you have to choose by yourself what whould you think that fits.


## Follow the kick (on- or offbeat)

> 1. Copy paste event from the Kick and nudge it offbeat.
> 2. Solo the Bass
> 3. Set Poliphony to 1 (whats the difference between 1 and legato?).
> 4. Move start time to create a nice bass sound (give it some attack).
> 5. Drive it.
> 6. Unsolo.
> 7. Check if the velocity is ok.

## Follow the chord progression

> 1. Copy/paste the root notes from the chord progression and _add bassnotes_ (1 octave lower then the root note, you can do this twice. So 2 bassnotes in 2 different octaves).
> 2. Change some of the bassnotes but stick to the scale (Now you are harmonizing using the bassnotes!).
> > 3. Repeat this also for the higher extended chords in the second part of the phrase.
> > 4. Select all those top notes (extended chord progression) from the second part of a phrase and transpose them down two octaves (instead of following the root note). This way the bassnotes becomes the high notes of the harmonisation. This completes the bass into the harmony.

## Create nice basslines using the sequencer

> 1. Program a pattern in the sequencer.
> 2. Hold any step and tweak it's parameters.

## What is a Reese bass?

Say you have two waveforms. Doesn't matter what they are. If you play them back together and they're perfectly in sync in frequency and phase, your output is the same waveform with twice the amplitude (6dB higher).

If you put the waves out of phase, but with the same frequency, you get constructive or destructive interference. Meaning, when they're perfectly in phase you get that 6dB boost, but when they're perfectly out of phase you get cancellation. In between those two points, you get different levels of reduction.

Now what happens when you vary the amount of phase offset with time? Now you get shifting amounts of phase interference, constructive and destructive. You get this nice wobbly texture to the sound.

So the question is: how do you control the amount of phase shift over time? Do you need a special synth for it?

Nope! It's actually really simple. You can prove this mathematically, but if one of the waveforms is detuned slightly, it amounts to that continuously changing amount of phase interference. We call that wobble a "beat" frequency. Meaning if you have two waveforms out of tune by 1 Hz, there will be one "wobble" in the sound per second, or a beat frequency of 1 Hz.

The "Reese" bass is a sound that makes use of those wobbly beat frequencies to create dynamic moving textures in the bass sound. It's common in drum and bass music, as well as dubstep and electro house.

**What it comes down to is you start with two waveforms and detune them so you get that wobble**. Or add more to make the wobble more complex. **You add more and more effects to either bring out that wobble and dynamic texture**, or add more. An example would be using **phasers** and **flangers** while **layering different sounds** together to get thicker, more interesting and continuously evolving bass sounds. Commonly at that stage people start calling it a "**neuro**" **bass** instead of a reese, **_a reese is usually considered to be just the detuned waves_**.

But that's just needless terminology, the concept is you create a continuously evolving and dynamic sound, and the easiest way to do it is simply detuning waveforms. The "classic" reese is made from saw waves.

# How to create a fast shortcut to delete and set you beat-grid, load marker and in/out fade cue points

<!-- SHIFT = CUE (deck A, B, C and D) -->
<!-- 1 - Delete every beat marker / grid point.
2 - Go to first cue point
3 - Set Beat marker

4 - Set mix/fade in point (32 bars before the drop (or break))
5 - Set end cue to mix out (32 bars before the end)

1. Zet de S4 op Ean's track prep en de rest naar de S4 uit (Traktor/Settings/Controller Manager)
2. Load alle tracks: Import to collection en als playlist, vink alle analyse opties uit (behalve Key en Replace Locked Values)
3. Verwijder alle Locks, Beatgrid, cue points, bpm van de tracks die je wilt voorbereiden
4. Load track: ****
5. Set autogain

First set that load marker (jogwheel push+turn and cue 1)!
6. sync = Loads next track + auto master mode on
7. cue = Resets song bpm and tuns sync off
8. play = play
9. jog wheel = skip true track, check bpm: listen to the master tick of the metronome
(Left loop knob = move track bpm)
(right loop knob = move beat grid/phase)
4. set autogain for headroom **(map this to gain knobs! / (shift + ) push gain = reset track gain!)**
5. push jog wheel, turn to the start and add a load marker by pushing the first cue button
6. set fade in and out markers (on the drop and end of the song)
7. lock the track (push right loop knob)

# # When to do this?

- zoom with the tempo fader or jog wheel
- Shift + Flux = **delete beat marker**
- Flux = **set beat marker** -->

## For keyboard and S4MK2

|   | Keyboard  | S4mk2  | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | `/~  | Sync  | Loads next track + Auto master mode ON  |
|   |   |   |
| 2  |   |   | set load marker with key 2 or cue 1, also delete and then remove beatgrid with shift + flux, release and press flux again  |
|   |   |   |
| 3  | 1  | Cue  | Resets song bpm and turns sync off  |
| 4  | 2  | Play  | plays the song  |
| 5  |   | Jog wheel turn  | skip true track, check bpm: listen to the master tick of the metronome
| 6  |   | Left loop knob  | move track bpm  |
| 7  |   | Right loop knob  | move beat grid/phase  |
| 8  |   |  | Set auto-gain **(map this to gain knobs! / (shift + ) push gain = reset track gain and for the keyboard - and + incl shift!)** |
| 9  |   | Jog Wheel push  |
| 10  |   |   | Set fade in and out markers/cue points (on the drop and end of the song/outro)  |
| 11  |   | Push shift + right loop knob  | Lock the track  |
|   |   |   |   |


### For the keyboard mapping:

THIS MAPPING IS INTENDED TO BE USED WITH 2 HANDS, WITHOUT THE MOUSE, SO YOU CAN GO THROUGH A SINGLE PLAYLIST OF NEW SONGS VERY FAST. PUT ALL YOUR NEW SONGS IN A LIST AND FOLLOW THE PROCESS. 

HERE IS THE PROCESS 

    ~ - JUMPS TO THE FIRST MARKER OF A SONG (THIS IS USUALLY TRAKTOR'S AUTO GRID MARKER)
    1 - SETS A LOAD MARKER AND #1 HOT CUE AT THAT POSITION.
    =  -  PAUSES THE TRACK, ZOOMS OUT AND STOPS THE METRONOME. (PRESS TWICE TO RESET THE MASTER CLOCK)
    DELETE - PLAYS THE TRACK, ZOOMS IN AND STARTS THE METRONOME
    TAB - SKIPS THROUGH THE SONG IN 32 BEAT INCREMENTS.
    { } - MOVES THE BEAT GRID FORWARD OR BACK AND ZOOMS IN VERY TIGHT. (ADD SHIFT FOR FINE CONTROL)
    (  ) - CHANGES THE BPM (WITH SHIFT FOR FINE CONTROL)
    2 - LOCKS/UNLOCKS THE BEAT GRID (PREVENTS THE BEATGRID FROM BEING CHANGED)
    3 - LOADS THE NEXT SONG

THIS ONLY WORKS WELL FOR NEW SONGS WITHOUT ANY CUE POINTS. 

    IF THE BEAT MARKER IS NOT IN THE CORRECT PLACE, SET A NEW ONE AND FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS
    IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CUE POINTS OR MULTIPLE BEAT MARKERS, DELETE EVERYTHING BUT THE FIRST GRID MARKER (WHICH SHOULD BE ON THE DOWNBEAT) AND FOLLOW THE PROCESS

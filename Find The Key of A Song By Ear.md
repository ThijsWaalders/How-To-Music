## Why
Because you want to play/mix/copy a song that you like so you want your instruments to play in the correct key so they will fit harmonically correct. Otherwise your melody and chords will be wack.
If you know the key of a song it is easy to figure out the melody or chords from that song (or create a new one that will fit).

## How
1. **Listen to the song**\
   Spend a few seconds to listen good and feel the music.
2. **Hum**\
   Hum only one note. 95% at the time your brain will give you the root note / tonic note. The other 5% is mostly a third or fifth away from the root/tonic note of the key.
3. **Find the note on your instrument**\
   Hum that note again and play some notes on your instrument until you get to the tone that corresponds to the tone that you are humming and if you've dong it right the song.
4. **Build the Scale**\
   Pick a Scale notation to write a Scale in key of your favorite song!

# HELP! I need ear training

Everyone can hear music in their head (sometimes you get a tune going round and round in there that you can’t get rid of), but learning to hear in your head what your eyes are seeing is a little harder. Take some music which you haven’t studied yet and try to read it without playing/singing it. Don’t panic - the more you practice, the easier it will get.

Start off with just 2-4 bars, and build it up as you become more confident. Choose music that moves in small steps, not in big intervals, and without lots of accidentals. Check what was in your head by playing the bars on your instrument. Were they the same?

Gradually move on to more complicated music- with difficult key signatures, tricky rhythms and huge leaps. Learning the skill of hearing music in your head also helps your sightreading a lot!

You might find it easier if you make some kind of physical reaction as you read - if you can sing, you might feel your voice-box subconsciously changing as you change notes; if you play an instrument it might help if let your fingers move on an imaginary instrument.

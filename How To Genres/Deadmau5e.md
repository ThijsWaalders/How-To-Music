# How to create tracks like Deadmau5e

1. Set **tempo to 125**
2. Record slapping your ass (in different rooms?), sample a few of them, **use multiple claps next to each other and reverse a few every 4 claps** for that sweeping sound (also a lot of SWING!!).
3. **Add ride symbal (4x4) in the second parts** for extra hihat effec to keep the flow going.
4. Use really **BIG ROOM drumkit** sounds
5. Use a Square wave + filter (envelope?) for the bass
6. Synth: saw envelope with a short decay/release for the plucky chords
7. Delay "2"(ableton) 1/8 time
8. Automate a lot!! (detune, cutoff, resonance, pulse width)
9. Use [Polymeters](#polymeters), **GOOGLEN!!!!**, do not confuse with [polyrythms](#polyrhythms). Polymeters are 2 different rythms in "speed" (e.g: one 3 beats long and the second one 5 beats long), so they won't end at the same time, just cut the chords off in the second bar.


## Polymeters
Here is a simple exampl e of 5/4 over 4/4 polymeter notated in 4/4 time. Notice how voice A's meter is five beats (the accents illustrates the starts), while voice B's meter is four beats, and they are sort of modulating over each other. After 20 beats their accented beats will coincide again. Important is that the beat tempo is the same for both voices!

5:4 Polymeter (notated in 4/4-time)
Here is the same example but notated in 5/4 time: 5:4 Polymeter (notated in 5/4-time)

You could also notate voices A and B each with a different time signatures (explicit polymeter notation), but it might look confusing if you're not used to it when the bar lines don't line up inbetween the staves.

## Polyrhythms
Here is a simple example of 5:4 polyrhythm notated in 4/4 time. Notice how both voices coincide and have emphasis on the first beat of each measure (or rather each complete beat ratio). Important is that the beat tempo is different between the two rhythms of voice A and B!

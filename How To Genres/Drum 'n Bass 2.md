# How To Drum 'n Bass

1. **Eerie sound (atmospherical)**
   - Play small segment of a dense cinematic sound/composition as a sample
   - Remove the click with the amp attack
   - Double it with an adjacent note (phase cancelling?)
   - One long midi note on beats 3 till 8
   - Add reverb / delay / chorus / saturator
   - Create more stereo
2. **Synth + Vocal stab**
   - Layer some stabs
   - Midi notes on beats 1, 3, 5 and 7
   - Add delay on 1/4th (quarter note)
   - Add saturator @ ±1 o 'clock
   - Lower the last note 1 octave

3. **Breakbeat**
   - Source and resequence multiple breakbeats
   - Timestretch and slice them
   - Add a HP Filter around 150Hz
   - Audio output through a compressor that side chains on your own sounds so it will duck the classic breakbeats when your own instruments/samples are playing
4. **Layer breakbeat with own samples**
   - Layer own sounds (kick + snare + percussions)
     - Hihats: 1/8th or 1/16th note, only pause when the hand is needed for another instrument/sound (or set polyphonic to max 4)
     - Velocity - Offbeat lower then the onbeat
     - Variate between tip + shoulder of the stick (1/4th or 1/8th note repeat, duplicate, nudge, shift + pattern humanize velocity for both)
     - Use short (foot pedal) HH closed on 3, 1/4th
     - Use Choke groups for open and closed ones and add here and there some open ones
     - For 16th: **never hit when a snare hits** and vary velocity, mix up tip + shoulder again
     - Open hat at the end of a phrase
       - Choke the first double hihats with a pedal
   - Use these sounds to trigger the Compressor (side-chain) and adjust the compressor + side-chain
   - **TIP** Use another compressor on top of your compressor and use it only for vocals, just a few dB's
   - Filter
   - EQ
   - Saturator
5. **Add percussions: Hihat, Ride, etc.**
   - Small fill @ end of 4 bars
   - Route all to 1 group/output and EQ/process it
6. **Reese Bass Processing**
   - F2# (sharp) note = Sick 47Hz Bass
   - BP Filter: cut the frequencies of your kick so they won't clash ±5dB (around 94Hz?)
   - Send to group/channel/track for the mids by 0dB
      - Enhancer
      - PremixCM
      - Saturator
      - HP @ 12 to 2 o 'clock
      - Automate the enhancer sometimes @ the end of a phrase
7. **808/Sub bass**

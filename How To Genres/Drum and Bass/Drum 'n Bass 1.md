# How To Drum 'n Bass 1

1. Snare on beats 2 and 4
2. Kick around the snare (sometimes on the snare is ok)
3. Bass is often one-quarter or halftime of the drum tempo, the more complex the faster the music appears to be
4. Apply pitch FX, Flanger, Phaser, Filters, EQ
5. Add a guitar, synthesis chords, sound effects, vocal
6. Create your own kick + snappy snare (kick 100/150Hz, snare with white noise + notch out the middle frequencies + modulate the pitch envelope up to the end)
7. Add multiple percussions
8. Create multiple loops (maybe combine 4/4 with 3/4, don't quantize, variate over time)
9. Bass simple 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 notes
   - Use pitchbend, glide, sine-wave, on long notes modulate filter, pitch
   - LFO low rate on envelope (resets on every note) or modulate the pitch up slow attack, medium decay
   - Sample raga/dancehall real bass sound, remake in a vst to prevent copyright (just create your own sound lazy ass)
   - The faster the lower the velocity
   - Map velocity to filter cutoff
   - Pitchbend max 2 semitones
10. Chords, copy bassline pattern and create a chord, when the bass goes up, chords go down and vice versa
11. Add a string that fits the chords (blz 356 van...?)
12. Add vocal(s), sound FX, MC's
13. Arrangement: Don't build up to a climax, use effects instead of new melodic elements

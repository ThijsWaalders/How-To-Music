# How To French Funk / House

1. Tempo 128 BPM
2. Lots of sampling (transpose up) + FX like tape stop / grain stretch
3. Pick an old school pop/funk song
   - Timestretch the song/sample so it fits the metronome
   - Cut the parts you want to use (like 1th 2nd 1th etc)
   - Compress (side-chain) the song with your own kick or more instruments so the song will duck when your kick hits
   - Use a lot of filters / bit crusher
4. Use a crash/cymbal at the end of every 8 bars

# How To House

- Program a minor7 / Major 7 in a synth (using multiple oscillators) and transpose the notes.


# How To Deep House

Make a hollow / analog / vinyl / casette / etc. track

- Set your BPM at 120 BPM.
- Add a Kick for 2x4.
    - Add a second kick on the other 2x4, so you get an kchlok, oents, kchlok oents like steps.
    - Create a louder version for after the drop (in the chorus 2/3/etc.), or just add bigger kicks.
- Plucky sounds: Layer 2 or more **MELODY**
    - Use 2 different notes for each instrument/vst (in minor) that are next to each other to create tension. Or set these notes further apart to create release.\
      If this doesn't work, just use 1 instead of both / tension etc.
    - Use many triplets and offbeat patterns (so for example in 1 bar 3 triplets and 2 offbeats on the: 1 - 1.4 - 2.2 - 3.2 - 4.2).
- Add a deep old bass. (sample old funk bass or make your own).
- Add a synth that sounds like water: Add a Chorus, Reverb and a Phaser.
- Use some black womans voice samples and maybe even pitch them down.
- Put a Closed Hi-Hat on every offbeat.
- Sample early disco or early funk (Don't forget to side-chain it so you can call it Future House).
- Add a Cowbell

- Add a model in your Album art

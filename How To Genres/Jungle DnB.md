# How To Jungle or Drum 'n Bass

Please read all of this, try to know what it all means, write down notes, research and then start to make your own idea, track or how-to.

- **Set your tempo** between 165 and 185 bpm
- **Sample one or more drumloops / breakbeats** like Funky Drummer or Amen Breaks and **timestretch** it
  - Find tempo of sample: **seconds** x **beats** = **Y**,    **60** : **Y** = **tempo**
  - Record 4 bars or 8, truncate 1 bar to zero-crossing _but not the first or last bar_
  - Divide 60 by destination bpm and multiply by nr of beats, there you have your timestretch time in seconds
  - Loop and listen if it sounds good
  - Slice it, change pattern (snare on 2 and 4, kick around it)
  - (Optional) _Layer multiple slices of sampled beats_ to create your own authentic sound
- Create your own **Snare, Kick and Sub Kick / 808** above the breakbeat you've created
  - Snare must be snappy, white noise, notch filter middle frequencies and modulate the pitch envelope up to the end
  - Kick should be just one, not layered
  - Create 808 / Sub kick _before EQ/Filter/Tune the kick_ so they won't clash
  - EQ Kick around 100/150Hz (depends on where the sub is mainly)
  - EQ Snare around 220Hz
  - Add Overdrive/Distortion/Saturation/Compression
- Create a raw simple 808 **bass/sub kick**, often one-quarter or halftime of the drum tempo, _the more complex the faster the music appears to be_
  - 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 notes _within one octave_
  - Use a Sine Wave, Pitchbend, Glide and modulate the filter and pitch on long notes
  - _LFO sync_ low rate on envelope (resets every time a note starts) or modulate the pitch up with a slow attack and a medium decay
  - _Use Glide!_
  - _Layer_ to create huge sick powerful low end
- **Sample _real bass_** from Ragga / Dancehall genres and remake them in a vst to prevent copyright
  - The faster (shorter notes), the lower the velocity
  - Map velocity to filter cutoff
  - Pitchbend to max 2 semitones
- **Apply FX** like Flanger, Pitch, Phaser, Filters, EQ's
- Copy Bassline Pattern and create some **Chords** for an **Electric Piano** (mostly (a) minor or Major), when the bass goes up, go down and vice versa to **create _tension and release_**
  - Sounds Design and add FX (chains)
- **Add _multiple percussions_**, you can't layer too much with this
  - Create multiple loops, try to combine 4/4 with 3/4 loops, _don't quantize!_ but vary over time
  - Tune the percussions so they won't clash with the Bass _and_ Kick
- **Add String Instruments or Analog Synths** that fit the chord progression and EQ so they won't overpower other elements
- **Add Sound Effects, Emotional Pads, Vocals, MC's**, (tremolo'ed _Mentaz_ samples)
  - Add atmospherical bleeps and bloops _in Scale_, Delay + Reverb + (in a part a) little Bitcrush
- Create **a lot of different drum breakbeats**

## Mix, Arrangement and Master(ing)

- **Pre-Mix** some envelope shapings, add a transient shaper, EQ
- **Arrangement**: don't build up to a climax, instead use/modulate effects or change patterns (Analyze and remake old-skool classics if you really don't know what to do)

  - **Intro** create an atmospherical sound that leads into your song or introduce your chords and HP filter your breakbeat and drop the filter / beat into the verse
  - 3 to 4 **verses** that tell the story
    - 1st - add rising synths at the end into the first bridge/break
    - 2nd - Omit stuff, add riser
  - **Chorus** moves the instruments up a key and gives something to sing along with and is very **BOOMING**
    - 2nd - add more Stuff
  - 8 bar **Bridge** is the break between verse and chorus and have mostly a drumfill and a bigger one into the middle-eight section
    - 1st - just a short simple 1 2 3 4 nothing break
    - 2nd - Main Drop, remove slow sounds
    - 3rd - Second Drop, add melodic elements
  - **Middle-Eight** use the circle of fifths and changes everything 1 key up
  - **Outro**

## Mix and Master tips

- Think about all the frequencies going through an effect, is it really necessarily? If not, Filter and/or EQ the other freq's away. This will help clear out your track/instruments/mix and spare a lot of cpu.

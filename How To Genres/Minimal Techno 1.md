# How To: Techno Minimal

Made with _Maschine_ (and later as audio tracks in _Ableton_)

**TO-DO:**

* I need to put everything together and split them into groups to use as audio tracks in Ableton.
* I can also make a To Do / How To for the stuff I need to do in Ableton with the Audio Tracks.
* I also want to use _Komplete Kontrol_ in Ableton so I need to split some vst like bass or something out of _Maschine_ for more functionality (it is not always needed).

1. Select **kick** drum, put in your pattern (4x4).
2. Find some **percussion** sounds, record a pattern (4x4, other 1 around beat 3 offbeat),
   quantize if needed and give it some **swing**.
3. Find a _tom_ or something and set it offbeat, solo it, tune it down (1 octave), add LP filter and unsolo.

**TO-DO:**
4. Add a second kick
5. Add a clap/snare

**TO-DO:**

Add this:

## First create your sound with a vst, if you want to use your vst, then sample it

### Kick

1. Create your pattern (mostly 4x4).
    2. Tune it.
        3. Drive it.
            4. Compress it.
                5. Give it a bit of attack (modulation).
                    6. Pitch it (modulation).
                        7. Check empty space before it hits/begins

### Bass

1. Copy paste event from the Kick and nudge it offbeat.
    2. Solo the Bass
        3. Set Poliphony to 1 (whats the difference between 1 and legato?).
            4. Move start time to create a nice bass sound (give it some attack).
                5. Drive it.
                    6. Unsolo.

### Check velocity

### Closed HiHats

1. Offbeat pattern
    2. Maybe some swing

### Percussions / Rimshot

1. Pattern.
    2. Add 1/8 swing around 20/25.
        3. Pitch it.
            4. Add FX.
            5.

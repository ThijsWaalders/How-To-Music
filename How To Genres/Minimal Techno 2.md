# How To Minimal Techno

1. Percussion Loop (first the groove)
2. Extra Percussions
3. Kick (Sub/Bass, offbeat)
4. Kick (mostly 4x4)
5. The rest is all about FX:


## Type of Effects

- Use a lot of Delay, Flanger, Phaser and of course the Reverb effects.

## Title 1

- Add Pre-Delay Â± 1 ms to some elements, for example:
    - Bass-line
    - Riffs
    - Percussion

## Pads

- Side-Chain your pads with a Gate

## Multi FX Chains

- Trow your short samples true Long Multi FX Chains.
- Use Glitchy FX before the Delay.

## Breakdown

- _For Buildups_ increase the rate & feedback, then at the peak carefully pull feedback and (dry/?)wet to zero.
- Raise your Bass-line 4 octaves higher in the 8 bar Breakdown.

## Ping Pong Delay into the next Phrase

- Ping Pong Delay for 8 bars, starting at Full Dry and end with Full Wet.
  - Then Pull the wet signal for 1 sec before the next Phrase.

## Master FX

- HP-Filter
- Tempo-Delay
- LP-Filter

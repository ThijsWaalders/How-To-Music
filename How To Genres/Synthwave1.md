0# How to Synthwave
## Type of instruments and FX
- Use 80 style instruments like 80's Drummer, 707's, classic analog synths, brass, old FM synths. Don't pick too modern instruments/sounds.
- Create a gated reverb!!

* You should pick a scale (like minor pentatonic) and stick to it, then:
1. **BPM**:
    - Don't go to fast for a song "out of the 80's". Use **100/110 bpm** or if you wan't to modernize it, go faster! Even 130bpm     can sound good but that's not really synthwave anymore.
2. **Bass Synth's** (Jup/Juno/Model-D):
    - **1/16th arp**, just the same note (D3).
    - **Add a new bass synth**, duplicate the previous pattern.
    - **Side chain these synths** bigtime to a ghost kick (attack bended upwards towards a straight line down before the kick begins)
3. **Drums**:
    - Grab **2 kicks** (70/80's), a very powerful one and..., 4x4 with some variation in the last +/-2 beats of the 4th and/or 8th bar. Set them to the same fx channel, **eq them both** group or both (duck the bass (more) and mid a tiny bit and cut the to high freq's).
    - **Add a Reverb** to the kicks (group), like +/- 10% dry/wet, room size round 40 (low cut 75Hz, high cut 4.0 kHz 0 pre delay).
4. **Filter the synth out**: start with the low's and go slowly upwards to the high's.
    - **High pass down**, leave the low pass and turn down the cutoff (+/- 10/20%).
    - **Automate the _Cutoff_ upwards** for 4 and keep it up to 8 or upwards to 8.
    - **Automate the _Cutoff Envelope_ for the kick** the same way (So both are rising).
5. Get the phattest **big room snare** you can find:
    - **EQ** it, low down (and the rest is a wobble).
    - add a **enourmous reverb** (+/- 45% dry/wet, low 75Hz, high 4.0 kHz room 40, pre-delay 0).
    - **Automate the Reverb envelope**:
        - When the 5th bar begins it will drop down (so you only hear it in the first 4 bars).\

**_- The rest of all these automations go full out afther the 4/8th bar._**

6. Add an **Lead Synth's** (80's/brass/FM8/DX7?):
    - Add **some high notes** (+/- octave 4/5) using your ear/the _psuedo leading tone_.
        - Maybe add some FX.
        - Maybe add a vocoder with the same pattern.
    - For the second phrase you should copy paste the (psuedo) leading tones and invert them.

7. Copy paste the second phrase from 6, remove the psuedo leading tones from phrase 1 and change the synth or patch.
    - Shorten some (psuedo leading) notes.
    - Let some Glide into some extra high notes.

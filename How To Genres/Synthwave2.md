# How to Synthwave
## Type of instruments and FX
- Use 80 style instruments like 80's Drummer, 707's, classic **analog synths**, brass, old FM synths. Don't pick too modern instruments/sounds.
- Create a gated reverb snare!!

## 1 CHORDS

1 80's style keys sound
- Play the chord progression as an arp (4 notes going upwards) for about 2 bars and then change the note for 2 bars (4 bars total)
- Add reverb
- EQ
- LP Filter the chord into the track as intro

2 Ambient sounds
- Create an ambient chord progression (the same as above but then without the arp) with a new sound

## 2 MELODIES

Use an epic powerful lead synth

- Use Nexus / Omni / etc, activate **portamento**
- Play a melody (in scale of course)
- Clean the sound with a HP Filter, EQ and delay.

Use a Brass lead

- Play another melody, "totally" different from the first (a bit slower).
- Clean the sound with a HP Filter, EQ and delay.

Use another sound and play the same last melody

## 3 DRUMS

Acoustic 80's kicks/hihats/cymbals/gated reverb snare is a must have!

- Make a short pattern with toms to help guide the rythm of the track (as an intro before the whole drumkit begins)

## 4 BASS

Use analog bass synths

- Use the root note from the chord progression and play it like 1/16th arp, make some notes longer than others.
- SIDECHAIN COMPRESSION with the kick ofcourse!
- Clean the sound with a Filter and EQ so it doesn't clash with your kick or other bass sounds

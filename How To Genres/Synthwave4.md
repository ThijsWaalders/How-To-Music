1. Pick 2 analog basslines and layer them (1/16th and pitch up at the end)
2. Heavy High ARP 1/16th + reverb (pitch up at the end)
3. 2x PADs layer + organ OR a 3 chords layer and SIDE-CHAIN with a 4x4 ghost kick and snare
4. Drums:
   - Kick 2x4
   - Gated reverb snare 2x4
   - Â± 3 Toms at the end, from high to low
   - Shaker 1/16th (hard, soft, hard, soft)
   - Extra kick and snare at the end
5. Sub Bass 1/16th (same as #3 pads, but only the root note)
6. Use a reversed clap at the end

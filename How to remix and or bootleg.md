# How to create a bootleg or a remix


1. Pick a (classic) song (example: Never ever from All Saints)
2. Load in DAW, Warp, check bpm of the track/sample with metronome and adjust till they beatmatch.
3. Set desired new bootleg/remix tracks bpm
4. Slice eclip sections, rename (add empty midi clips with info what to do)
5. Add a simple Boom Tak, BOEMTAK! dnb Kick Snare
6. Search for the chords and create a bassline: sine-wave with LFOsync WOB WOB WOB WHUUUUHUUUUUH(screaming)!
7. Seearch breakbeat, timestretch and slice it and then resequence your own beat.
8. Build to chorus (intro + pre-chorus), breaks, bridge into the middle eight = chorus?.

* Use reversed breaking glass sounds before a snare
* Snare + Clap + WHite Tail Noise
* use toms 1/16th all 4 from high to low, 1, 2, 3, 4, BOOM!



There is your bootleg / remix

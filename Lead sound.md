# Some info about the leading sound

A lead instrument...
* ...could be a reference to an instrument that **plays the melody**.
* ...**is usually monophonic** (only able to sound one note at a time).

## How to make it a big lead
1. **Layering** _A new sound on top_ of your lead sound (or an octave apart), copying the same pattern.
2. **Harmonise** It’s amazing how our perception of a sound changes when _a chord progression accompanies it_.
3. **Swap the sound** A very simple tactic but one used to great effect in every genre of music. _Contrast creates interest_.
4. **Effect Washes** Anything from distortion and bit reduction to delays and phasers can give your sound a fresh lease of life. _Don’t be afraid to use multiple effects at once_.
5. **Transposition** Simply _copy your pattern up an octave_ to add more tension in the breakdown _or transpose it to another key_ to shift the vibe of your track.

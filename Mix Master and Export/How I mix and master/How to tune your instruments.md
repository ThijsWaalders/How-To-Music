# How to tune your instruments to the key of a song

1. Add **Guitar Rig** and open up the Tuner.
2. Set the key of your song and enable the **Tune Fork**
3. Play the instrument on the key of the song and tune the instrument until you'll hear and/or see it is in tune.

That's it! Eazy peazy!
It's just keeping your instruments in tune (like tuning a guitar), so your instrument's aren't a quart note or more out of tune.

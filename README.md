# How to Create Music

In these documents I'll try to collect all the information that I've learned to create good sounding tracks _including real music theory_.
Unfortunately, I can not share everything I've learned without getting a lawsuit on my pants, so if you really want to know more about the traditional music theory try to contact me and maybe I can give you some tips or let you know where I've bought it and what's my opinion about it.

# Songwriting Secret-The Oasis Technique
How to create a song from an 8 bar loop (assume you build for the chorus) all in key:
1. **Start with a rythm** (Rythm = Red)
   - Set/tap your BPM.
   - Create a beat (Rythm = Red):
       - Begin with the kick/snare/hihats (start in idea mode).
       - Move the hihat a very little after inserted as midi to create some **groove**.
       - Lower some sound volumes in the mmixer.
       - Build up to different 8 bar patterns for building up in the scene mode arrangement later.
2. **Write a chord progression** (Chords = Cyan)
    - Draw a chord progression (also try one by one in ideas first):
        - Build a chord 1 bar long.
        - Create a rythm with/from the root note and copy it next to it for the progression later (double the pattern?).
        - Then only change a few bottom notes (bassnotes) from the first chord.
        - Use the psuedo leading tone to know where the root note from the next chord should be (so select all midi in the second bar and move it up/down).
        - Change some bottom notes again.
        - Duplicate the pattern and change the (last) chord again (just listen to the psuedo leading tone).
3. **Create a Melody** (Melody = Magenta)
    - Copy/paste the bottom notes from the chord progression and move them one or 2 octaves up.
    - Repeat this for both (all) patterns.
4. **Create a Bassline** (Bass = Blue)
    - Instead of copying we start to create something new, use your _psuedo leading tone_: just listen to your ear what notes and lengths you want to hear (hum or whistle).
    - Use some short and low velocity notes for mute notes (percussive transients).
    - Try to create some _tension_: notes that are close to another note that is playing at that time (e.g. from the chords or melody).
    - Check if all notes are in the scale, if not try to move the offscale notes to fit.
    - Create some tension (get some notes close to the notes from the chord progression).
    - Duplicate the pattern and change notes.
5. Finally **Omit and add things**
    - Duplicate all patterns (the 8 bar loop) and make the scene unique. Check what's inside the intro/pre-chorus/chorus/etc. that you wan't to make and then:
    - Omit things like removing the bass and or melody in the first part. Just listen to what you wan't to listen and mix some things away.
6. Yeah boyyyy UPLOAD IT TO SOUNDCLOUD!!!

# 808

## Using a self oscillating filter

1. Pick a **Filter** that can self oscillate (like the Minimoog)
2. Crank the **Resonance** up high and the filter will output a sine tone
3. The pitch is given by the filters **frequency / cutoff** (You might need to change some other settings like **filter type**
4. Modern 808's are often saturated to give the midrange presence on mid range speakers, so give it some **feedback** for weight and agression
5. Now you have a basic sine tone, so give it a tight **envelope modulation to the filters frequency** for that front end bump punch
6. **Note Gate Out --> Envelope Gate In - Out --> Mod Filter Cutoff** and play with the amount of modulation and filter settings to give it a kick style shape
7. Give the **Amp Envelope a long Release time** to get that lengthy bass heavy tail
8. Now **Enable Filter Key Tracking** so the sound will keep up with the Note Pitch of your keyboard (use Note Pitch to modulate Filters Cutoff)


## Using a sample or oscillator

1. You can also use a Sine wave sample or a oscillator with a **sine wave as mono / non polyphonic / 1 voice output**
2. Set the **Amp Env settings** to a **fast attack** (0), a **medium to long decay** (444ms), and a **long release** (3200ms)
3. Now set the **Flt Env to change the Pitch to 12st**
4. A pure sine ware lacks harmonics and tone which won't be hearable on small speakers so give it some **saturation** or **distortion**

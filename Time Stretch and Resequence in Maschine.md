# How To Time Stretch And Then Resequence Correctly in Maschine

## Timestretch

1. Load your sample / breakbeat
    - Set polyphonic to 4 or less (a person has only 2 arms and 2 legs, I mostly put it on Legato) and under PAD MODE set Choke Group to a number of choice
2. Check the tempo of your sample by setting a midi note on the first beat, set your pattern length to the length of the sample in bars and be sure your sample is set to one-shot
3. Turn on the metronome and hit play, tap the (Maschine) tempo while listening to your samples tempo. This will get you close to the right tempo
4. Now fine adjust the tempo by checking if the play marker line reaches the end of the sample
5. Now you have your samples tempo
6. Listen how much you want to tune in the sample and turn it back to 0 before you timestretch
7. Turn off the auto tempo under timestretching and set it manually
8. Set how much you want to tune your sample in the timestretch options
9. Set samples BPM and set your new tracks tempo and apply (i've used auto and 2 bars this time)

## Slice

10. Mode: Grid (better slice on transients so Detect may also be possible), Slices: 8TH (2 bar loop), _BPM: Manual, Adjust: tracks BPM_
11. Apply to group for easier further processing each slice/sound or apply it to 1 sound for edit in keyboard mode (single = only that slice is applied)


## Resequence

12. Resequence the shit out of it, double, change the doubled part and reply (pedal hit after open hihats)
13. Set 1st beats velocity high and the rest lower


40. Add a HP Filter on the breakbeat group and set it around 150Hz to give your own kick 'n basses their room.


### Additional

**Find tempo of a sample**

1. How many seconds does it last?
2. How many beats does it have?
3. Divide the numbers from #1 by 2
4. Divide 60 by the number from #3

**Find what length in seconds to timestretch to**

1. Divide 60 by your destination tempo/bpm
2. Multiply by the numbers of beats

Now you have the length in seconds at your destination tempo/bpm

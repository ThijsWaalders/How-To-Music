# How To Time Stretch And Then Resequence Correctly in Maschine

## Timestretch

1. Load your sample / breakbeat
    - Set polyphonic to 4 or less (a person has only 2 arms and 2 legs) and under PAD MODE set Choke Group to a number of choice
2. Listen how much tune you want to change and turn it back to 0 (set the amount of tune u want later in the stretch settings step 7)
3. Check samples tempo by setting a midi note on the first beat and set your pattern length to the length of the sample
4. Play and tap with the samples tempo so you'll get a decent tempo (Check with the metronome)
5. Fine adjust the tempo by checking if the play marker line reaches the end of the sample
6. Now you have your samples tempo

7. Set how much Tune you want in the Stretch settings

8. Set samples BPM and set your new tracks tempo and apply (i've used auto and 2 bars this time)

## Slice

9. Mode: Grid (better slice on transients so Detect may also be possible), Slices: 8TH (2 bar loop), _BPM: Manual, Adjust: tracks BPM_
10. Apply to group for easier further processing each slice/sound or apply it to 1 sound for edit in keyboard mode (single = only that slice is applied)


## Resequence

11. Resequence the shit out of it, double, change the doubled part and reply (pedal hit after open hihats)
12. Set 1st beats velocity high and the rest lower


20. Add a HP Filter on the breakbeat group and set it around 150Hz to give your own kick 'n basses their room.


### Additional

**Find tempo of a sample**

1. How many seconds does it last?
2. How many beats does it have?
3. Divide the numbers from #1 by 2
4. Divide 60 by the number from #3

**Find what length in seconds to timestretch to**

1. Divide 60 by your destination tempo/bpm
2. Multiply by the numbers of beats

Now you have the length in seconds at your destination tempo/bpm
